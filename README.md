# Traffic Bebop

> An experimental, early-stage web game inspired by the traffic management in classic SimCity 2000. Written in TypeScript 3.8 with PixiJS (a 2D WebGL renderer).



## Requirements

- NPM v6.9.0+



## How to Play

Use the tools to create roads, residential zones, and commercial zones. Control the speed of the game via the "Speed" menu. Randomly, residents and businesses will move in. Traffic will begin to generate from the residences to the businesses. The ultimate goal is to ensure that traffic stays flowing without backing up.



## Development

1. Clone the source code.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx webpack` to build the distributable files.

This project uses ESLint with the Prettier plugin for code formatting.
